# Supplier Hub

MyBizGate website for **Supplier Hub** (slug `supplier`).

- Source stays readable in Git; production artifacts are built into `dist/` by the shared MyBizGate platform.
- `main` is development, `deploy` is production. Pushing to `deploy` builds and deploys automatically.
- Hosting target: `public_html/demo/supplier/` → https://demo-supplier.niagova.com
- Configuration: `site.config.yml`.
